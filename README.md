# MLB-Contract-AI-ML-Project
This repository is home to my personal project for CSE 30124 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. The project goal is to create a software that takes MLB player data (such as age, WAR, OPS, ERA, etc) and establish a model that will predict future production of players. This will enable users to see potential contract offerings in the future.
